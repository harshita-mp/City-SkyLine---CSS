# City Skyline with CSS

## Overview
City Skyline with CSS is a project that demonstrates the creation of a simple skyline scene using HTML and CSS. It showcases various buildings, windows, and background elements to create a visually appealing representation of a city skyline.

## Features
- **CSS Styling:** The project employs advanced CSS techniques such as gradients, linear and radial backgrounds, flexbox layout, and CSS variables to style and structure the city skyline. These CSS features enable the creation of complex visual elements with precise control over their appearance and layout.

- **Building Structures:** The project illustrates the versatility of CSS in designing different types of buildings within the skyline. It showcases buildings of varying heights, widths, colors, and window configurations, demonstrating the flexibility of CSS for creating diverse architectural elements.

- **Responsive Design:** The skyline is designed to be responsive, meaning it adapts its layout and appearance based on the viewport size or screen resolution. This ensures that the skyline remains visually appealing and functional across a wide range of devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

- **Dynamic Color Transition:** One notable feature of the skyline is its ability to transition between a daytime and nighttime appearance. This transition is achieved dynamically through adjustments in CSS variables for building and window colors. As a result, users can experience the changing ambiance of the city skyline from day to night.
